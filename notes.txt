-Base HTML is from HTML5 boilerplate (stripped down to what is necessary)
-Build system is grunt. after creating package.json I installed grunt and grunt modules via CLI using "npm install *** --save-dev"
-Logo provided had a red background so I swithed it to a white background
-the main westfield logo is first loaded as an svg so it is scalable and looks crisp on high DPI devices. if this fails (ie the device doesn't support svg it will load the normal jpg logo)
