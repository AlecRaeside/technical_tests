# Westfield Front-end Developer Technical Test

## Instructions

Please build out the mockup found in *design_assets/mockup.png* directory, it's a listing page to display all Westfield centre deals.

The result should:

- Be responsive, you can decide how the design should best scale for smaller screens.
- Be centre aligned in the browser viewport. 960px is the maximum width of the design and 320px is the minimum screen width to support.
- Be the entire contents of the `body` i.e. there is no header/footer.
- Use dynamic data from our API's (see *API/JavaScript* section below), the deals search however should be completely static as we're only interested in the HTML/CSS for this.
- Work in the following desktop browsers and devices (if you don't have access to any devices then testing in an emulator is fine):
	- IE9+.
	- Latest version of all other major browsers.
	- Latest iOS OS devices.
	- Latest Android OS devices.
- Use CSS3 whenever possible and degrade nicely for browsers that do not support advanced features.
- Use Sass CSS pre-processor if possible.
- Use a HTML5 `doctype`.
- Consider high resolution screens i.e. retina.
- Take into account:
	- Accessibility
	- Performance
	- Maintainability
